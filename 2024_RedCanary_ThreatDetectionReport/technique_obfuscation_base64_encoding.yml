status: experimental
description: |
    If youâ€™re looking to detect malicious use of Base64 encoding, consider monitoring for the 
    execution of processes like powershell.exe or cmd.exe along with command lines containing 
    parameters like ToBase64String and FromBase64String. The following simple pseudo-analytic 
    might help you find malicious obfuscation. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat Detection 
    Report.
