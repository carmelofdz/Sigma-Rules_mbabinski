title: Suspicious PowerShell Cmdlets - WMI
id: e29d3301-3b64-4305-9e91-8aabfbef2015
status: experimental
description: |
    There are numerous default PowerShell cmdlets that allow administrators to leverage WMI via 
    PowerShell. Both adversaries and administrators use these cmdlets to query the operating 
    system or execute commands, either locally or remotely. Cmdlets like Get-WMIObject are often 
    used for reconnaissance. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat Detection Report.
