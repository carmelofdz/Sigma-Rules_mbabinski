title: Service Control Manager Spawning Command Shell with Suspect Strings
id: cdf9f0ba-857a-4f91-9f30-724ade93b797
status: experimental
description: |
    The following pseudo detector should generate an alert when services.exe spawns 
    cmd.exe along with a corresponding echo or /c command, which are common attributes 
    of post exploitation that weâ€™ve seen in association with this technique. Part of 
    the RedCanary 2024 Threat Detection Report.
