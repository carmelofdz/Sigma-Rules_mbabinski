status: experimental

    Reconnaissance is harder to detect because it looks very similar to normal admin behavior. 
    Even so, we detect a relatively high volume of adversaries leveraging WMI to quickly gather 
    domain information such as users, groups, or computers in the domain. The following may help 
    you detect related activity. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat Detection Report.
