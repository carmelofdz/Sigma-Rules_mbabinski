title: Application Bypass with DllRegisterServer Function
id: 06c7a5b8-24dc-482c-8203-c674a7e05c56
status: experimental
description: |
    DLLs that are designed to be loaded by Regsvr32 are expected to have a 
    DllRegisterServer export function implemented. Adversaries will often 
    supply the same DLL to rundll32.exe as well. Executing the DllRegisterServer 
    export function with rundll32.exe is tradecraft that’s unique to adversary 
    behavior and is rarely seen in legitimate scenarios. We’ve observed this 
    behavior in threats including Qbot, Ursnif, and Zloader, to name a few examples.
