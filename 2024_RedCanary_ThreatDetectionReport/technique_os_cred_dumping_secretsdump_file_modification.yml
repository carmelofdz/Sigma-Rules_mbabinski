    Impacketâ€™s SecretsDump utility consistently involves the Windows Service Host 
    (svchost.exe) writing randomly named .tmp files to the System32 directory. The 
    following pseudo-detector should offer defenders a reliable method of detecting 
    Impacket's SecretsDump utility. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat Detection Report.
