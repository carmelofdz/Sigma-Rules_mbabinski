title: Suspicious Commands - WMI
id: 5a6a9a1b-97d0-43d8-9dd7-3cdef056c3c3
status: experimental
description: |
    Looking for suspicious command-line parameters is another solid indicator of malice. Certain 
    red team and post-exploitation frameworks will spawn unique and unsigned binaries or commands 
    remotely using the well known process call create command, and weâ€™ve got a couple different 
    detection methods that have alerted us to related activity over the years. Potentially 
    suspicious WMI command switches include create, node:, process, and call. Of course, the 
    maliciousness of these commands are context-specific, and therefore, the following may 
    require tuning or generate high volumes of false positives. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat 
    Detection Report.
