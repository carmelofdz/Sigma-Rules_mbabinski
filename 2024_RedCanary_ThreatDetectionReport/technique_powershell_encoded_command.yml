title: PowerShell -encodedcommand Switch
id: 2f0c5dcb-71aa-44d7-abc6-dac43f121138
status: experimental
description: |
    This detection analytic looks for the execution of powershell.exe with command 
    lines that include variations of the -encodedcommand argument; PowerShell will 
    recognize and accept anything from -e onward, and it will show up outside of 
    the encoded bits. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat Detection Report.
