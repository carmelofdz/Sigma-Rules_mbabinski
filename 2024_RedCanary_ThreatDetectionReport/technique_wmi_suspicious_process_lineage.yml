title: Suspicious Process Lineage - WMI
id: 75e6bb57-d135-4308-b0ac-936e2d76d4d5
status: experimental
description: |
    In general, trusted binaries and known administrative tools and processes will initiate WMI 
    activity. As such, it makes sense to look for known bad processes launching WMI or deviations 
    from the expected where a legitimate but unusual Windows binary spawns WMIâ€”or spawns from it. 
    The following is an amalgamation of several analytics that can detect a wide array of threats, 
    ranging from red team activity to web shells to coinminers. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat 
    Detection Report.
