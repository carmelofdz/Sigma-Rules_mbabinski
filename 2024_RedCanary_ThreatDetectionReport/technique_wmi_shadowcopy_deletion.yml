title: WMI Shadow Copy Deletion
id: 1c078d3c-749c-40ce-9400-c2dbad604764
status: experimental
description: |
    Itâ€™s not uncommon for ransomware operators to leverage WMI to delete volume shadows, 
    significantly complicating the process for recovering access to encrypted systems and files. 
    If you want to detect ransomware using WMI to delete shadow copies, consider looking for 
    wmic.exe execution with command lines including shadowcopy or delete. Part of the RedCanary 
    2024 Threat Detection Report.
