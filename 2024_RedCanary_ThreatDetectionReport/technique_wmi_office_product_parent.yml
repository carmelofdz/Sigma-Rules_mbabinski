title: Office Products Spawning WMI
id: 0c2d39af-2c24-42c4-9bab-35e30ad2aeb8
status: experimental
description: |
    Itâ€™s almost always malicious when wmic.exe spawns as a child process of Microsoft Office and 
    similar products. As such, it makes sense to examine the chain of execution and follow-on 
    activity when this occurs. The following is a non-exhaustive example analytic that will catch 
    some of this activity. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat Detection Report.
