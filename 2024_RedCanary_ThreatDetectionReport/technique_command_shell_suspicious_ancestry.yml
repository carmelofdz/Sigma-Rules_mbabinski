    We have a lot of detection analytics that seek out suspicious or unusual process 
    lineage spawning or spawning from cmd.exe. Many of them donâ€™t often generate confirmed 
    threat detections but can occasionally raise the flag on important threats, like 
    Exchange compromises. One semi-common pattern in our library of analytics is suspicious 
    process interactions between the Windows IIS worker process (w3wp.exe) and the command 
    shell. The following amalgamation of analytics might help you detect a diverse array of 
    malicious activity related to web server compromises. Part of the RedCanary 2024 Threat 
    Detection Report.
