title: Application Bypass with RunDLL32 and DllRegisterServer Function
id: 361f2190-4857-4505-aaf9-588013b390f1
status: experimental
description: DLLs that are designed to be loaded by Regsvr32 are expected to have
    a DllRegisterServer export function implemented. This detects use of the same DLL
    to rundll32.exe. Inspired by the 2022 Red Canary Threat Detection report.
